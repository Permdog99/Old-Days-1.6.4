OldDays, NBXlite and SpawnHuman return old things that were removed.
NBXlite is fork of InsanityBringer's NoBiomesX.

SSPC is a fork of simo_415's Single Player Commands 3.2.2.
Everything in src/client/spc, bin/spc-* and bin-old/spc-* is licenced under GNU LGPLv3.

This Repository is for people to have access to the Old Days 1.6.4 releases.
They are not obtainable anymore because the downloads do not work.
So I recompiled the 1.6.4 source code using this: https://github.com/gus33000/Minecraft-mods/tree/universal-scripts

All credit goes to Exalm and his team. I just recompiled it.
